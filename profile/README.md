<h1 align='center'>Hi 👋🏼</h1>

It's nice to have you here and thanks for joining!

Your joining is meaning a lot to me as it supports me in focusing on maintaining my projects and up with new ideas instead.

In this GitHub organization, I have several private working-in-progress projects that you can have early access to them and give early feedback/requests or even participate in decision making, those might affect how and where the projects go.

When I feel one project is good enough to be publicized, I might transfer it to my main account [@elonehoo](https://github.com/elonehoo), or form a new organization with its collaborators, depending on the project.

You may also find my projects that are already open-sourced on [this page](https://elonehoo.me/projects.html).

You can send an [email](mailto:hi@elonehoo.me) or send a message to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elonehoo), pulling you into the organization.
